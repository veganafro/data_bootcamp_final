# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to explore the idea of income inequality and its effect on voter turnout rates.

# Goals and Methodology Overview
We hope to compare four countries grouped into two buckets and analyze income distribution compared to voter participation.
Those countries and buckets include two nations where nationalism is surging (the US and the UK) as well as two nations perceived as
more left leaning (Canada and Australia). The nations were chosen as such given their similar wealth and status.

# Outcomes
They're coming...
